# wordled

It's a wordle clone made with svelte, the twist here is that you can play as much as you like, and the app keeps track of previous words you've found and their descriptions on local storage. We also have different modes:

- **survival**: You get 2 lives, each word you guess will be 1 point, get as far as you can!
- **timed**: You're on the clock, guess as many words as you can before time rans out!
- **context-clued**: Like survival, but you have fewer guesses and a phrase that uses the word you're guessing, censored of course.
- **zen**: no lives, no time, just casually playing wordled and learning about new words.

For each mode, you can also select if you want 5, 6 or 7 letter words. The scoreboard will be separated for each.
